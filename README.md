- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

- What did you do particularly well?

- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I found implementing the mapped container to be by far the most challenging portion of code to write. Since I had no experience with maps, 

- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I definitely think that using containers--particularly map containers--is a useful and transferable skill. Additionally, although this wasn't the first project for this course to involve multiple files, it was certainly good practice to get used to dividing up my program into class declaration, definitions, and main. 

- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I added in-line comments to all code as I was writing it. Once I was done, I added more detailed descriptions above my functions to ensure readability. I saved this for last since serveral of my functions underwent significant change from what I had originally planned for them. Additionally, maintaining separate but well-documented files did wonders for the readability of my code.
